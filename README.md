# smart-school-bus-chatbot-v1.0
Chatbot for supporting Smart School Bus system, Chattogram (https://smartschoolbus.gov.bd)

This project is designed to run entirely on **Google Colab**, making it easy to use without any local setup.  
It provides step-by-step execution of code blocks, ensuring that even beginners can follow along and reproduce the results.  

You can explore, modify, and run the code in your own Colab environment without needing to install additional software.  
The main goal of this repository is to provide a simple, reproducible workflow for your project.  

---

## Setup
1. Open the Google Colab link provided in this repository.  
2. Make sure you are signed in to your Google account.  
3. Click **"Copy to Drive"** to create your own editable copy.  

---

## Configuration
- No installation is required — everything runs directly in Colab.  
- If external credentials (such as API keys, dataset paths, etc.) are needed, you must enter them manually in the notebook.  
- Replace placeholders like `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual values when prompted in the notebook.  

---

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.  
2. Run each cell sequentially from top to bottom.  
3. Provide any required inputs when prompted (such as credentials or dataset links).  
4. Review the outputs and modify parameters as needed.  

---

## Example
```python
# Example: running a function in the notebook
result = my_function(input_data)
print(result)
````
