RAG Chatbot is not just about searching exact info from a dataset; it enhances AI by retrieving relevant knowledge to generate context-aware, accurate, and evidence-based answers. 🚀🤖

For our company FronTech’s new project Smart School Bus Solution, I developed a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based chatbot 🚍🤖.

This chatbot can extract information from PDFs and provide relevant answers to user queries. The technologies I used include:

• Python: For core logic and creating embeddings
• Sentence-Transformers + NumPy: For data vectorization and similarity computation
• OpenAI API: Using GPT-4 to generate context-aware answers
• Streamlit: For the user interface and interactive experience

A challenging part was that the embeddings’ similarity scores sometimes came out very low (0.65 or 0.6%), 😅 yet the chatbot still provides relevant information accurately.

Future plans (for parents): Connect the chatbot with the live system so parents can track bus location, departure, and arrival in real-time 📍👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. This will make the system more human-friendly and interactive.
